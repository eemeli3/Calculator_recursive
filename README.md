# Calculator_recursive
Calculator for evaluating mathematical expressions consisting of basic mathematical operations. Made with C++ in Visual Studio. The program calculates the expression recursively.

"evaluate_expression_recursive_code" folder contains the code as text files. "miscellaneous" and "recursive" are header files.

# The calculator only works in Visual Studio. Will be fixed soon.
